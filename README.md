# arcane-beauty-lounge-demo
This website was originally developed for Arcane Beauty Lounge, a real local business in the Philippines as part of a three-person intern team under Servscale Technologies, Inc. This repository contains my personal continuation and responsive reimplementation of the project, rebuilt and redeployed independently for portfolio and learning purposes. I no longer have access to the original organization repository or production deployment. This version is not the live production site and is not actively maintained by the business.

Backend features such as form handling were originally implemented by another team member and are mocked in this version.
